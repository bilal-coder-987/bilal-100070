Project Description:
      This project implements barcode detection and decoding using computer vision techniques.
      It utilizes OpenCV for image processing and Zbar for barcode recognition.
      The system can detect various types of barcodes in images and decode them to extract the encoded information.
      It provides an efficient solution for automated barcode reading applications.

Objectives:
      To detect barcodes in images using image processing techniques.
      To decode the detected barcodes to retrieve the encoded data.
      To implement the solution using Python and relevant libraries.
      To evaluate the performance on sample images.

Tools & Technologies Used
      "Python"
      "OpenCV"
      "Zbar"
      "NumPy"
      "Matplotlib (if used)"
      
Steps to Run the Code
      Ensure Python is installed on your system.
      Install the required libraries: pip install opencv-python pyzbar numpy matplotlib
      Navigate to the Code/ directory.
      Run the main script: python barcode_detect_and_decode.py or python detect_barcode_opencv.py
      Provide input images from the Dataset/ folder.
      View the output in the Results/output_images/ folder.
      Sample Input and Output Images
      
   Input Image: An image containing a barcode, e.g., a product label with a QR code or linear barcode.
   Output Image: The same image with the barcode highlighted and the decoded text displayed.
  (Refer to Results/output_images/ for actual samples.)
  
Conclusion
      This project successfully demonstrates the application of computer vision for barcode detection and decoding.
      By leveraging OpenCV and Zbar, we achieved accurate detection and decoding of barcodes from images.
      The implementation can be extended for real-time applications such as inventory management or retail scanning.
      Future improvements could include handling more barcode types and optimizing for performance.
